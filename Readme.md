## 🚀 How to Set Up & Run

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Target2026/DDOS-Project
   cd DDOS-Project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
# On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
# On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
Install all required libraries listed in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the project:
 Navigate to the src/ folder where your main Python script (e.g., main.py) is located.
 Run the Python script to start training or testing the model:
 ```bash
 python main.py
 ```
